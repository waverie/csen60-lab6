Question: Whatâ€™s the difference between how your website is rendered in Lab 4 vs. Lab 6?

Answer: In Lab 4, I could render my website by just copying and pasting the path into my browser. From reading the slides, this desribes client-side rendering (CSR). In Lab 6, I had to open the localhost link above into my browser and then go to the link, put a dash, and enter the name of the html file I wanted to view. From the Server slides, this action is Server-side rendering (SSR).
